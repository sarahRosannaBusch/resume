            <h2 class='topGradient'>About Me</h2>
            <p class='padded'>
                I am a software developer whose expertise is primarily in custom web-based user interfaces for embedded systems. I changed career paths from chemistry six years ago, because software development is the perfect fit for my creativity and analytical thinking. I have a passion for learning and developing new skills, and like to work independently within a collaborative team to produce a quality product. You can check out some of my code at <a href='https://github.com/sarahRosannaBusch' target='_blank'>my github account</a>, which is mostly school projects and experiments, plus a <a href='http://www.centripetalphotography.com/' target='_blank'>site I'm currently working on</a>. 
            </p>
            <p class='padded'>
                I'm originally from Ontario, and have lived in Victoria since 2009, where I love to cycle, kayak, drink beer, and play boardgames with my friends. Feel free to follow me on facebook or instagram if you want to learn a little more about me.
