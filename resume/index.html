                <br>
                <p class='padded'>
                    I'm a software developer with a background in electronics engineering and chemistry. I have a passion for creating things that both look great and work well. I love to learn and develop new skills, and like to work independently within a collaborative team to produce a quality product. 
                </p>
                <p class='padded'>
                    I'm originally from Ontario, and have lived in Victoria BC since 2009, where I love to cycle, kayak, and play boardgames. Feel free to follow me on LinkedIn or Instagram if you want to learn a little more about me. And check out my GitHub account to see some examples of how I code.
