        <h2>Train Control and Maintenance UIs</h2>
        <p>For three years I was the lead front-end developer at Quester Tangent for their on-train monitoring and diagnositics systems. I created the front-end framework for the built-in crew displays and maintainer/engineer portable display units (aka laptops). This includes both the graphical user interfaces as well as the web servers that exchange data with each of the train's subsystems. See my <a style='font-size: 12pt;' href='../resume/index.html'>resume</a> for more details.</p>

        <h2>Scheduler App</h2>
        <p>I was contracted to develop a scheduler application for LaneLight Traffic Technologies. It is embedded in their development website and is compatible with Chrome, Firefox, and Edge. The app consists of a calender and various settings used to setup and test the in-road pedestrian crosswalk lights shown in the link below. </p>

        <h2>Centripetal Photography</h2>
        <p>A portfolio website that I wrote for a local photographer. (He's still in the process of adding his work, so you might just be seeing his placeholder photos here.)</p>

        <h2>Tech Horizons</h2>
        <p>My capstone project from Camosun College, where I learned to design and build electronic devices as well as to write code. I decided to focus the project on the Internet of Things because that is the area I found most compelling throughout the program.</p>

        <h2>Budgie Blog</h2>
        <p>I wrote this blog about my budgie Apollo while I was still in school, to exercise my web development skills. I'm pretty sure it's a big part of the reason I got hired at Quester Tangent as the layout is very similar to the first project they gave me.</p>

        <h2>Shoot Kill Loot</h2>
        <p>A little game demo for an idea I've been toying with. Sorry, this version is mouse and keyboard only, so if you're viewing this on a phone or tablet it's not going to work.</p>
