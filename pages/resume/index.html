                <p class='padded'>
                    I'm a freelance software developer with a background in electronics engineering and chemistry. I have a passion for creating things that both look great and work well. I love to learn and develop new skills, and I like to work independently within a collaborative team to produce a quality product. Check out <a href='../swPortfolio/index.html'>my portfolio</a> to see what I've been working on recently.
                </p>
                <p class='padded'>
                    I'm originally from Ontario, and have lived in Victoria BC since 2009, where I love to cycle, kayak, and play boardgames. Feel free to follow me on <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-rosanna-busch-641ab44a/' target='_blank'>LinkedIn</a> or <a href='https://www.instagram.com/annarose0113/' target='_blank'>Instagram</a> if you want to learn a little more about me.
