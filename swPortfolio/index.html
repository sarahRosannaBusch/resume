        <h1>Software Portfolio</h1>
    </header>
    <p>These are some examples of little projects that I've done for fun and to expand my skillset. The code is not as clean, well documented, or fully tested as my professional work, but it shows a bit of my creativity and style. (The links will open in a new tab.)</p>

                Photography Site
            </a>
        </h2>
        <p>This is a site I'm currently working on for a photographer friend of mine, to display his work. He's still in the process of editing the photos he wants to display, so I've just stuck a few of mine in there for now, to test it out.</p>

                Budgie Blog
            </a>
        </h2>
        <p>I wrote this blog about my budgie Apollo while I was still in school, to exercise my web development skills. I'm pretty sure it's a big part of the reason I got hired at Quester Tangent, as the layout is very similar to the first project they put me on.</p>

        </h2>
        <p>A little game demo for an idea I've been toying with. Sorry, this version is mouse and keyboard only, so if you're viewing this on a phone or tablet it's not going to work.</p>

        </h2>
        <p>My capstone project from Camosun College, where I learned to design and build electronic devices as well as to write code. I decided to focus the project on the Internet of Things because that is the area I found most compelling throughout the program.</p>
